# JP-Blog
This is my personal blog website. It is intended to showcase my use of CSS flexboxes and grids. It is also meant to be a dynamic layout that scales depending on the screen size.

At the moment there is only a homepage and one blog post but the idea is to host this in my own personal page at some point in the future.

P.S: I will not call it "JP's Blog", I just happened to struggling with creativity at the moment :)
